RTMP stands for Real-Time Messaging Protocol. 
It is a proprietary protocol developed by Macromedia (now owned by Adobe) for streaming audio, video, and data over the internet. 

Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

-> Low Latency: RTMP is designed for low-latency streaming, making it suitable for live broadcasts and real-time applications.

-> Persistent Connection: It uses a persistent TCP connection, which ensures reliable delivery of streams.

-> Chunked Data: RTMP divides the data into smaller chunks for transmission, which allows for efficient and continuous streaming.

-> Flexibility: Supports a variety of codecs and is flexible enough to handle different types of data, including audio, video, and text.

-> Adaptive Streaming: Can dynamically adjust the quality of the stream based on the available bandwidth, providing a smoother user experience.
