RTSP stands for Real-Time Streaming Protocol. It is a network protocol used for streaming media, such as audio and video, over the internet in real-time. 

Essentially, it allows you to control streaming media servers, providing commands like play, pause, and stop.

To implement RTSP in Python, you typically use libraries such as OpenCV for handling video streams.

Features of RTSP:

-> Control streaming media servers
-> Provides commands to control media streaming (e.g., play, pause, stop)
-> Application-level protocol
-> Commands:  DESCRIBE, SETUP, PLAY, PAUSE, TEARDOWN, etc.
-> run both on TCP and UDP
-> Text-based protocol with human-readable commands
-> Can re-establish sessions and control error conditions
-> Default port 554
-> Works with RTP for media delivery
